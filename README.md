# Bowling-Mini-Project
Game Physics Mini Project 2019

Move with W, A, S, D.
You can jump with SPACE.

There are a couple of options:
1. Change ball mass (it is in kg)
2. Change ball speed magnitude (velocity)
3. Change ball jump impulse
4. Change the bounciness after landing a jump. (Coefficient should be between 0 and 1)
5. Hit velocity impulse (streching - Hooke's Law)

To run the porject just use the build .exe file in the folder (...)
